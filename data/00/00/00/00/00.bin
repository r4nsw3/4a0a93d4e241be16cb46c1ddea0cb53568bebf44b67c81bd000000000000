  |   Dead End Job sends you into a madcap, whacky world to bust up         |
  |   ghosts. It's a procedurally generated, couch co-op, twin-stick        |
  |   shooter that straps a vacuum pack to your back, and puts a plasma     |
  |   blaster in your hand. For you, it's just another day in the office.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You take on the role of Hector Plasm, a worker at Ghoul-B-Gone -      |
  |   'the Number One experts in paranormal pest control' - as you're       |
  |   tasked with heading to haunted offices, restaurants, and other        |
  |   everyday buildings before freeing them of unwanted guests.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Have you got what it takes to be the best at putting pests to rest?   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Play alone or bust ghosts with a buddy in drop in / drop out co-op    |
  |   that works seamlessly within the main adventure.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Do you love 90's cartoons? Yeah, so do we, and we grew up on their    |
  |   stretchy squishy gross-out laughs. Our love for them spills over      |
  |   into the game like so much ectoplasm. See every nose hair in wacky,   |
  |   vibrant art that brings everyday items to life as screwball spooks    |
  |   to suck up.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Exercise that fighting spirit, since every specter you snag and       |
  |   every resident you rescue is added to your client's bill at the end   |
  |   of the job. Haunted by the ghost of your mentor, quite literally,     |
  |   you must learn the ropes and to save her soul before she's forced     |
  |   to spend eternity as a spook (voted "Least Preferred Fate" in Ghost   |
  |   Hunter Monthly).                                                      |
